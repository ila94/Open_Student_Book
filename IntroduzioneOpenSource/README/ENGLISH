##Introduction to synergic/cooperative team-working and Opensource
Informatics intends the Open source as a software where programmers can do changes or add extensions to publics source-codes.
Shortly, "the recipe" for having a good job is shared, free and everybody can take advantage of.
What kind of advantages do we might excpect? The advantage is collaboration and sharing ideas among the group. In doing this, we
have the opportunity  that our ideas could be reinterpratated, or (using other words) ameliorated costantly, and adapted to larger
contexts; furthermore it's possible with team-work to achieve higher standards, thanks to our knowledges put together, than
individual one alone. It's important to clarify that "open-source" doesn't mean "loose the control" on your own work, quite the 
contrary the "recipe"inventors check and choose what could be added on their initial projects or not.
Why the concepts/meanings of open source and cooperative projecting are so important in University field? As an example, let's take in 
consideration an open source platform like moodle (which is an essential instrument for academics for a couple of years). Through 
Moodle, people can easy share immediately the necessary educational material and pass the exams. Moodle permits people to keep abreast
thanks to blogs, the chats and (educational units?)(come termine non mi piace moltissimo, nè in italiano, nè in inglese. E' già stato
specificato con l'esempio del mondo accademico che il materiale didattico viene condiviso.), but also quiz and feedbacks offer an 
active participation where students and teachers can have dialogue.
